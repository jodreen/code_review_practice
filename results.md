The three functions we decided to analyze are:
1. reshape
2. get_increment
3. mean

Comments on Jordeen's Code:
reshape
- code clarity: clear
- brevity: short
- code performance: fast, 592 ns per loop
get_increment
- code clarity:
- brevity: short
- code performance: 1.75 microsec per loop
mean
- code clarity: relatively clear, uses an intermediate variable
- brevity: longer
- code performance: uses built-in map 143 microseconds per loop
