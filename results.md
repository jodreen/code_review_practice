The three functions we decided to analyze are:
1. reshape
2. get_increment
3. mean

Comments on Alon's Code:

"reshape" is as good as it can be.

"get_increment" didn't need an if/else clause but it works.
Code performance wouldn't be affected by that, but brevity could have been improved.

"mean" is clean, short, and fast since it makes use of an iterator.
Nothing unnecessary is run.
