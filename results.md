The three functions we decided to analyze are:
1. reshape
2. get_increment
3. mean

Comments on Lisa's Code: 
- reshape: looks good :)
- get_increment: can save values that you use often to variables (e.g. len(shape) and len(shape)-1),
	so you aren't calculating length of shape every time
- mean: should check for case when axis is None
